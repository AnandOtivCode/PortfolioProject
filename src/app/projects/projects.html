      One of my most recent creations in watercolor. This was actually created using a references I found in watercolor magazines
      along with a bit of my own twist with how I enjoy the lighting. I am a big fan of the winter season and really enjoy
      how snow decorates nature.

    <p>
      One of my older paintings from when I first started painting. This was where I got to have fun with two favourite things, birds and snow.
      I always find the need to challenge myself and in this painting I had to tackle the strange colors of a metal fountain contrasted with
      the background of the winter outdoors..
