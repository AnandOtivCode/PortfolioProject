        One of my most recent creations in watercolor. This was actually created using a references I found in watercolor magazines
        along with a bit of my own twist with how I enjoy the lighting. I am a big fan of the winter season and really enjoy
        how snow decorates nature.

        One of my older paintings from when I first started painting. This was where I got to have fun with two favourite things, birds and snow.
        I always find the need to challenge myself and in this painting I had to tackle the strange colors of a metal fountain contrasted with
        the background of the winter outdoors.

        The Shiba Inu is the smallest of the six original and distinct spitz breeds of dog from Japan.
        A small, agile dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain, the Shiba Inu was originally
        bred for hunting.
