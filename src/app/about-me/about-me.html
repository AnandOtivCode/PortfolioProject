  <h3>My Skills</h3>
<mat-tab-group>
  <mat-tab class="matt-tab" label="Front End Web Development">

    <mat-icon>web</mat-icon>
    <p> With taking computer programming at college I have a lot of experience building and editing websites. As of now I'm able to use HTML, CSS and Typescript
    to create a website from scratch.</p>

  </mat-tab>

  <mat-tab label="Game Development ">
    <mat-icon>sports_esports</mat-icon> <mat-icon>terminal</mat-icon>
    <p> I got started in game development from a computer science class when I was in high school. I've played around with Small Basics, Pygame and JavaSwing. I really enjoy
    being able to work on games as It's an easy way to express myself and I get the satisfaction of doing plenty of problem solving. I am currently working on learning 3D  game development using
    the <a href="https://unity.com">unity game engine</a>, as I'd like to build an immersive sandbox game. I also plan on making my games multiplayer because I'd love to learn and use networking skills on a fun project.</p>
  </mat-tab>

  <mat-tab label="Perspective Design">
    <mat-icon>design_services</mat-icon>
    <p> My first time working with perspective design would have to be when I took an introductory art class, where we learned to make city scenes in 1 and 2 point perspective.
    I have progressed to working on a course called <a href="https://drawabox.com">Draw A Box"</a> where the foundations of spatial reasoning are taught through theory and practical examples.
    A goal of mine is to actually create a game from scratch incorporating assets that I create, and to get further along this goal I consistently work on my painting and sketching. </p>

<h3>My Favourite Hobbies</h3>
<mat-tab-group>


  <mat-tab label="Language Learning">
    <mat-icon>language</mat-icon>
    <p> I am currently studying French and Russian, but I also do some dabbling in Arabic and Chinese.
    I enjoy being able to take what was once gibberish and later convert that same noise into meaningful input.</p> </mat-tab>
  <mat-tab label="Martial Arts">
    <mat-icon>sports_martial_arts</mat-icon>
    <p> As of right now I train kickboxing, jiu-jitsu and wrestling. I actually got into martial arts by accident
    back in 2021 when I was looking for some physical activity to get into and ended up getting into MMA. What I enjoy most is the
    technical aspects of it, where leverage, distance, time and footwork are used to have the upper hand. There is also the physical training  aspect
    which is fun, as I get to see myself improve in strength and conditioning session by session. </p> </mat-tab>
  <mat-tab label="Video Games">
    <mat-icon>sports_esports</mat-icon>
    <p> My favourite video games far would have to be FPS shooters and Jackbox games . Among my favourite titles would have to be
    the Battlefield series, Quake and Jackbox Party Pack 4. The biggest factor for my enjoyment I find is the social aspect of video games
    as it allows me enjoy time and memories with my friends in a pretty unique way. With this in mind I've actually started to learn some unity game dev
    on the side, as I'd like to create games of my own that are fun, so i can share the joy.</p> </mat-tab>
  <mat-tab label = "Comedy">
    <mat-icon>theater_comedy</mat-icon>
    <p>
    I actually went to my first stand up comedy on June 20th 2025 with a headliner named
    <a href=" https://torontoguardian.com/2025/01/toronto-comedian-gee-gethiga/"> Gee Gethiga</a> at a bar called The Tipsy Toucan.
    I was used to just watching comedians on youtube but I realized after seeing the live show how much more level of fun being
    live at the actual event actually is. After that event I've become a big fan of comedy and try to go as often as I can. I find that comedy is a really
    good way to help destress and just in general enjoy life in the present moment.
