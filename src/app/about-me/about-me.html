<p>about-me works!</p>

<mat-card class="example-card">

  <p>Hello! My name is Anand Otiv and I'm a currently a student at St.Clair for <a href="https://www.stclaircollege.ca/programs/computer-programming">Computer Programming</a>.
    My main interests in my field include Machine Learning and AI, Game Development and Cyber Security. I myself am a big fan of Information Technology
    and how everything works. When I need a break from computers I enjoy film, literature, and painting.</p>

<h3>My Favourite Hobbies</h3>
<h4> Language Learning</h4>
<p> I am currently studying French, and Russian, but I also do some dabbling in Arabic and Chinese.
  I enjoy being able to take what was once gibberish and later convert that same noise into meaningful input.</p>
<h4> Martial Arts</h4>
<p> As of right now I train kickboxing, jiu-jitsu and wrestling. I actually got into martial arts by accident
as I was looking for some physical sports to get into and ended up liking mixed martial arts very much. What I enjoy most is the
technical aspects of it, where leverage, distance, time and footwork are used to have an upperhand. There is also the physical training  aspect
which is fun, as I get to see myself improve in strength and conditioning session by session. </p>
<h4> Video Games</h4>
<p> My favourite video games far would have to be FPS shooters and Jackbox games . Among my favourite titles would have to be
the Battlefield series,  Quake and Jackbox Party Pack 4. The biggest factor for my enjoyment I find is the social aspect of video games
as it allows me enjoy time and memories with my friends in a pretty unique way. With this in mind I've actually started to learn some unity game dev
on the side, as I'd like to create games of my own that are fun, so i can share the joy.</p>
<h4> Comedy </h4>
<p>
I actually went to my first stand up comedy on June 20th 2025 with a headliner named
  <a href=" https://torontoguardian.com/2025/01/toronto-comedian-gee-gethiga/"> Gee Gethiga</a> at a bar called The Tipsy Toucan.
  I was used to just watching comedians on youtube or tv, but I realized after seeing the live show how much more level of fun being
  live at the actual event is. After that event I've become a big fan of comedy and try to go as often as I can. I find that comedy is a really
  good way to help destress and just in general enjoy life in the present moment.
